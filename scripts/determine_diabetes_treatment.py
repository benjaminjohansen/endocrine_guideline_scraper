    - familial_predisposition (bool): Indicates familial predisposition to early onset of cardiovascular disease.
    - uncontrolled_hypertension (bool): Indicates uncontrolled hypertension.
    - dyslipidemia (bool): Indicates dyslipidemia despite treatment.
    - smoking_pack_years (int): Number of pack years of smoking.
    - treatment_goal_achieved (bool): Indicates if treatment goal is achieved based on HbA1c.
    - glucose_lowering_effect (str): Desired glucose-lowering effect.
    - weight_reducing_effect (str): Potential weight-reducing effect.
    - own_insulin_production (bool): Indicates own insulin production.
    - potential_side_effects (bool): Indicates potential side effects.
